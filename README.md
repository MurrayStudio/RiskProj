# RiskGame
## Introduction

This is an Android based version of the board game *Risk*. It was originally implemented by [Garrett Becker](https://github.com/yoyoma207), [Lucas Burns](https://github.com/burnscommalucas), John Will Bryan, Logan Mealy, and [Shamus Murray](https://github.com/shamu11) for CS 301 (Object Oriented Design) in April 2015. The map is simplified, with a 16x16 grid of tiles in place of full countries. A sample of the map can be seen below.

##

- Player actions are simplified to attacking countries directly adjacent to the selected country (Up, Down, Left, or Right, but NOT diagonal).
- No Risk Cards are available in the current version. 
- Dice rolls are performed automatically in the background based on number of troops in each country.
